Corrections to staff draft:

* Corrected the date in the linkroles on enum elements (BR-AG)
* Added missing trailing '/' to rewrite URL (XII, Corefiling)
* Added missing children of IECWindTurbineClassAxis (BR-AG)
* Removed duplicative "OtherStandardMember", coalesce on "OtherStandardsMember"
* Fixed missing ELR for PriorityFoodIngredientsListing enunm2:linkrole: Added FoodIngredientDomain to ELR 995000, set enum2:linkrole of PriorityFoodIngredientsListing to that ELR "https://xbrl.ifrs.org/role/ifrs_sds/ifrs_sds-dim_2022-05-25_role-995000" (Corefiling)
* Correct references in Appendix B that have extra letter at the end that does not correspond to content of Appendix B, eg IF-EU-540a.2a or IF-HB-000.Ca (DFIN)

Changes:

* Changed all the 'Abstract' elements that were being used as parents of domain member lists in ELR 995000 to 'Domain' Elements - more consistent with use in Axes, avoids mix of types of top level item (Abstract and Domain) - Required changing ClimateRelatedRiskOrOpportunityAbstract to IsClimateRelatedRiskOrOpportunityDomain (BR-AG)
* Changed all references to Appendix B to example not disclosure references
* Remove "dual-layout" ELRs (700000,710000,720000,730000) that combined S1 and S2 elements (that are all also present in the main S1 and S2 ELRs 200000,210000)
